This part aims to get familiar with features analysis. A feature could be any information measured on the set of studied samples.

## CytoPrep: prepare features for MeV

1. Run CytPrep on RStudio
2. Scale interactively the feature set

## MeV: visualize features, then apply statistical analyses

1. Import annotated features
2. Use Significance Analysis of Micro-arrays tool
3. Use ANOVA with two factors
