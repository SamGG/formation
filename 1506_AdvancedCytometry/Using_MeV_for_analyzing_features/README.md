This part aims to get familiar with features analysis. A feature could be any information measured on the set of studied samples.

## CytoPrep: prepare features for MeV

1. Install shiny library within RStudio: Run CytPrep on RStudio: shiny::runGitHub('bioinfoxtra/cytometry', subdir='cytoPreparePercent')
2. Scale interactively the feature set

## MeV: visualize features, then apply statistical analyses

1. Import annotated features
2. Use Significance Analysis of Micro-arrays tool
3. Use ANOVA with two factors
