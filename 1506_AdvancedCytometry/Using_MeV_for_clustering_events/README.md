This part aims to get familiar with MeV and to understand some basic concepts in event clustering.

## Hierarchical clustering

1. Import data from sim7pop5dim_mev.tsv
2. Change: Color scale, Element size, Color palette
3. Heatmap view, label groups
4. Grouping similar events (aka genes) using Hierarchical Clustering, Euclidean distance, Average linkage (or Complete)
4. Optional: Use Pearson correlation as distance
4. Optional: Use ManHattan as distance
5. Try to guess clusters count using Figure Of Merit

## Dimmension reduction

1. Apply PCA as dimension reduction and try to see clusters

## Density reduction

1. Open a new viewer
2. Import data from sim7pop5dim_mev_equ.tsv
3. Apply Hierarchical Clustering
4. Try to guess clusters count	using Figure Of Merit

## Dimension effect

1. Open a new viewer
2. Import data from sim7pop30dim_mev.tsv
3. Apply Hier. Clustering
4. Alternatively, redo with sim7pop30dim_mev.tsv

Have fun!
